# Free-Code-Camp-2018
My code for the new rollout of Free Code Camp's massive 2018 curriculum update

Each certificate program is meant to take 300 hours to complete. I have made the decision to complete every single challenge for each certificate that I obtain from FCC.

A user does not need to accomplish every single challenge within each certificate program to obtain the certificate. Instead, they just need to complete the 5 projects at the end of each program, which get progressively more difficult.
